/*
 * ICT1002 (C Language) Group Project.
 *
 * This file implements the behaviour of the chatbot. The main entry point to
 * this module is the chatbot_main() function, which identifies the intent
 * using the chatbot_is_*() functions then invokes the matching chatbot_do_*()
 * function to carry out the intent.
 *
 * chatbot_main() and chatbot_do_*() have the same method signature, which
 * works as described here.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   inc      - the number of words in the question
 *   inv      - an array of pointers to each word in the question
 *   response - a buffer to receive the response
 *   n        - the size of the response buffer
 *
 * The first word indicates the intent. If the intent is not recognised, the
 * chatbot should respond with "I do not understand [intent]." or similar, and
 * ignore the rest of the input.
 *
 * If the second word may be a part of speech that makes sense for the intent.
 *    - for WHAT, WHERE and WHO, it may be "is" or "are".
 *    - for SAVE, it may be "as" or "to".
 *    - for LOAD, it may be "from".
 * The word is otherwise ignored and may be omitted.
 *
 * The remainder of the input (including the second word, if it is not one of the
 * above) is the entity.
 *
 * The chatbot's answer should be stored in the output buffer, and be no longer
 * than n characters long (you can use snprintf() to do this). The contents of
 * this buffer will be printed by the main loop.
 *
 * The behaviour of the other functions is described individually in a comment
 * immediately before the function declaration.
 *
 * You can rename the chatbot and the user by changing chatbot_botname() and
 * chatbot_username(), respectively. The main loop will print the strings
 * returned by these functions at the start of each line.
